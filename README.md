### Benefits: -

- ***Understandable Code***: You can make your code understandable to everyone. For example, if you are using singleton pattern, then anyone viewing your code can understand that here you want to make only one object of a class and you want to access the same object through out the application.

- ***Code Reusability***: You can make your code reusable i.e. for performing a certain task at more than one place, you don't need to write the same code again and again at various places.

- ***Cleaner Code***: You can make your code cleaner by decoupling the code and it will make the code easier to understand by using Design Pattern.

### Types of Patterns: - 

| Pattern | Description |
| :-- | --- |
| Creational | The Creational Pattern is used to create some object without showing the logic or the steps that are involved in creating the object. |
| Structural | Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures. The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships. These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes. |
| Behavioural | Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects. In these design patterns, the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled. That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies. |
